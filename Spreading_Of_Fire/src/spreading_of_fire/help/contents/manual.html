		<h2>Installation</h2>
		<p><strong>For user</strong>
		</p>

		<ul class="task-list">
			<li>The Java must be installed, either JDK or JRE. We recommend Java 1.8 as it is the version that we used.</li>
			<li>Open "Spreading_Of_Fire.jar"</li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>For Developer</strong>
		</p>

		<ul class="task-list">
			<li>We recommend Netbeans IDE 8.0.1 with JDK 8u25.</li>
			<li>Open Netbeans IDE then File -&gt; Open Project ...</li>
			<li>Select folder "Spreading_Of_Fire".</li>
			<li>The source code was separated in 7 parts

				<ul class="task-list">
					<li>Spreading_Of_Fire : The class that will initially run, used for running the main class</li>
					<li>Main : The class that will load the Model, View, and Controller.</li>
					<li>Model : The core of the application, every functions of the application are in here.</li>
					<li>Controller : The input of the application, it will control and config the parameter of Model.</li>
					<li>View : The output of the application, it will receive data from Model and represent it.</li>
					<li>Cell : The class that contains the cell properties.</li>
					<li>Help : The help window that appears when you push the help button in controller</li>

		<p><strong>Step</strong><br>
			The number of times that the fire spread. The step count starts with 0.<br>
			
		</p>

		<p><strong>Show Value</strong><br>
			The status of showing values of the simulation.

		</p>

		<ul class="task-list">
			<li>true - Show both values and symbols.</li>
			<li>false - Hide the values and show only symbols.</li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>Lightning Status</strong><br>
			The status of showing how the lightning cells burn.
		</p>

		<ul class="task-list">
			<li>true - The cell will take 5 step to become an empty cell at step 6. The cell will spread fire in step 2, 3, and 4, and not spread fire int step 1, and 5.</li>
			<li>false - The cell will immediately become an empty cell after it was burned. In other word, the cell will act like usual fire cell.</li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>Remaining Tree</strong><br>
			The percentage of the trees left from the beginning. The value is calculated by (The current number of trees)/(the initial number of trees) x100%.

		<ul class="task-list">
			<li><strong>Spread</strong> - Spread the fire step by step. By pressing this button, the step count will increase by 1.</li>
			<li><strong>Auto Spread</strong> - Spread the fire respectively. By pressing this button, the step count will continually increase by 1.</li>
			<li><strong>Stop</strong> - Stop the spreading process. By pressing this button, if <strong>Auto Spread</strong> was pressed, the step counting will be stopped.</li>
			<li><strong>Reset</strong> - Reset the field. By pressing this button, the field will be reset and the step count will become 0.</li>
			<li><strong>Toggle Value</strong> - Toggle the status of showing values of the simulation. By pressing this button, the field will show or hide the value alternatively.</li>
			<li><strong>Step Lightning</strong> - Toggle the status of step lightning of the simulation. By pressing this button, the Lightning status in the view will toggle the value alternatively. The meaning of value can be read above.</li>
