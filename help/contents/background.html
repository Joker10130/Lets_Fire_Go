			Everyone knows that fire is a danger. Fighting fires work on risk job, where we could loss of life is a real possibility. Therefore, Proper training is necessary. In the United States, the National Fire Academy, presents courses and programs that are intended “to enhance the ability of fire and emergency services and allied professionals to deal more effectively with fire and related emergencies” (Studebaker 2003).The academy has developed a three- dimensional land firefighting training simulator. This simulator is training trainees to predict spreading of fire, where trainers can be a variety of fuel types, environmental conditions, and topography. Trainees may call for appropriate resources and construct fire lines for action of these variable. The aim of this is student can review the results of their decisions, where they can learn from their mistakes in the safety of a computer laboratory (Studebaker 2003).

			Modeling is the application of real-world problems. The reason that we use modeling is because it’s too difficult, time-consuming, costly, or dangerous to perform experiments. So we use computer simulation, or having a computer program imitate reality.
